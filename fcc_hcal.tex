\begin{abstract}
Jet substructure variables for hadronic jets with transverse momenta in the range from 2.5~TeV to 20~TeV
were studied using several designs for spacial size of calorimeter cells. The studies  used 
the full Geant4 simulation 
of calorimeter response combined with realistic reconstruction of calorimeter clusters used 
in jet reconstruction. 
The results indicate that the performance of jet-substructure reconstruction 
improves with reducing cell sizes.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Particle collisions at energies  beyond those attained at the LHC will lead to many challenges for detector technologies.
Future experiments, such as high-energy LHC (HE-LHC),
future circular $pp$ colliders of the European initiative, FCC-hh~\cite{Benedikt:2206376} and the Chinese initiative, SppC~\cite{Tang:2015qga} will be required to measure high-momentum bosons ($W$, $Z$, $H$) and top quarks with strongly 
collimated decay products that form jets.  Studies of jet substructure can help identify such particles.

The reconstruction of jet substructure  variables for collimated jets with transverse momentum above 10 TeV 
require an appropriate detector design. The most important for reconstruction of such jets are tracking and calorimeter.
Recently, a number of studies \cite{Calkins:2013ega,Chekanov:2015ihl,Coleman:2017fiq} 
have been discussed using various fast simulation tools, such as 
Delphes  \cite{deFavereau:2013fsa}, in which momenta of particles
are smeared to mimic detector response. 

A major step towards the usage of full Geant4 simulation to verify the granularity requirements 
for calorimeters was made in \cite{Chekanov:2016ppq}.
The studies included in this paper have illustrated a significant impact 
of granularity of electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimeters on the
shape of hadronic showers  calculated using calorimeter hits 
for two particles separated  by some angle. It was concluded that high granularity is essential 
in resolving two close-by particles for energies above 100 GeV. 

This paper makes another step in  understanding of this problem in terms 
of high-level physics quantities typically used in physics analyses.
Similar to the studies presented in \cite{Chekanov:2016ppq}, this paper is based on a full
Geant4 simulation with realistic jet reconstruction.

\section{Simulation of detector response and event reconstruction}
 
The description of the detector and software used for this study is discussed in \cite{Chekanov:2016ppq}. 
We use the SiFCC detector geometry with a software package that
represents a versatile environment for simulations
of detector performance, testing new technology options, event reconstruction techniques for future
100~TeV colliders.

The \GEANTfour\ (version 10.3)~\cite{Allison2016186} simulation of calorimeter response was complemented 
with the full reconstruction of calorimeter clusters formed by the Pandora algorithm \cite{Charles:2009ta,Marshall:2013bda}.
Calorimeter clusters were built from calorimeter hits in the  ECAL and HCAL after applying the corresponding sampling fractions.
No other corrections are applied.
Hadronic jets were 
reconstructed with the {\sc FastJet} package~\cite{fastjet} using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm \cite{Cacciari:2008gp}
with  a distance parameter of 0.5. 

In the following discussion, we use the simulations of a heavy $Z'$ boson, 
a hypothetical gauge boson  that arises from extensions of the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model.
The $Z'$ bosons were simulated with the masses, $M=5$, $10$, $20$ and $40$~TeV. The lowest value 
represents a typical mass that is within the reach of the LHC experiments. The  value $40$~TeV 
represents the physics reach for a  100~TeV collider. The $Z'$ particles are forced to decay 
to two light-flavor jets ($q\bar{q}$), $W^+W^-$ or $t\bar{t}$, where
$W$ and $t$ decay hadronically. In all such scenarios, two highly boosted
jets are produced,  which are typically back-to-back in the laboratory frame.
Typical transverse momenta of such jets are $\simeq M/2$.
The main difference between considered decay types lays in different jet substructure. In the case of the $q\bar{q}$ decays,
jets do not have any internal structure. In the case of  $W^+W^-$, each jet  originates from $W$, thus it has two
subjects because of the decay $W\rightarrow q\bar{q}$. In the case of hadronic top decays, jets have three subjects due
to the decay $t \rightarrow  W^+\>b \rightarrow q\bar{q} b$.    
The signal events were generated using the \pythia generator with the default settings,
ignoring interference with SM processes.
The event samples used in this paper are  available from the
HepSim  database~\cite{Chekanov:2014fga}.
